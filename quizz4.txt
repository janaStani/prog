Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. 
It is a powerful tool that can be used to simplify complex problems, but it can also make the 
code difficult to understand and debug. In practice, recursion should be used with caution 
because it can lead to infinite loops or stack overflow errors if not used properly. However, 
when used correctly, recursion can make the code more elegant and readable, especially when 
dealing with problems that have a recursive structure, such as tree traversals, permutations, 
and backtracking. In my personal opinion, programmers should use recursion when it makes the 
code more readable, but they should also be mindful of the potential pitfalls and test their 
code thoroughly to ensure it runs correctly.
